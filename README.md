This program was written as part of a course requirement in my post-bacc coursework. The program emulates Langton's Ant, a universal
Turing machine developed by Chris Langton in 1986. It has very simple rules that govern behavior, but shows order coming from chaos
after about 10,000 moves. More info at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant

This was writen in VIM using Red Hat Linux command line interface.

To run:
1. Download the ALL files for the sim.
2. In your Linux command line navigate to the file folder.
3. Type "make" this will build the objects for the program.
4. Type "make program1" this will build the program from the objects.
5. Type "program1" in the command line.
6. Hit enter and enjoy.
